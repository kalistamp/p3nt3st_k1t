Pen-Testing Recon:

Basic recon :

Directory brute forcing
Subdomain brute forcing
Web Crawler / Spider
HTTP Headers

You can also check for Javascript files to find hidden endpoints and assets.

You can also find old links with waybackurls that can reveal more endpoints or information that a developer probably forgot to delete.

Tools: subfinder, dirsearch, hakrawler, burpsuite, waybackurls, linkfinder, ffuf, spyhunt
